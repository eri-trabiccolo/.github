LifterLMS Dot Github
====================

A `.github` repo for the gocodebox (LifterLMS) organization.

### Label Sync

The [labels.json](./labels.json) file describes the issue and pull request labels shared across organization repositories.

The [labels.yml](./.github/labels.yml) workflow runs daily to sync labels from the config file and will automatically sync labels when the config file is updated. It can also be dispatched manually to update repositories on demand.
