# We build open source technology to democratize education in the digital classroom.

At the heart of our efforts here on Github is our [free LifterLMS core plugin](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms).

At LifterLMS, we put our users and our usersâ€™ users at the center of what we do. We provide software, support, content, and community for our users so that together we can lift up others through education. 

LifterLMS launched to the public in October of 2014.

# Our Open Source Solutions

We do things the WordPress way

- We think using the GPL license will result in the best code.
- Similar to WooCommerce, we contribute our core LifterLMS plugin for free to the community on the WordPress repository.
- As WordPress evolves, we evolve with it.
- We contribute to open source WordPress projects and accept contributions.

# LifterLMS

LifterLMS is a WordPress Learning Management System (LMS) solution for creating, launching, and scaling online learning platforms.

# Our Core Values

Our core values exemplify the people we enjoy working with. These values exemplify the people we are and strive to be. We hire based on these core values. Our employee review process focuses on these core values.

Our core values help us to make decisions about our work. When we are stuck between two alternative courses of action, the option that is most inline with our core values is the one we should take.

- Community Focused
- Reduce Friction
- Continuous Improvement
- Learner Results First
- Extreme Ownership
- Clear Communication
- Actualize Potential

# How We Use GitHub
Code is a huge part of what we do. Every feature, menu option, user interface, and word in our software has been strategically added with code.

However, it takes a lot of work to store, maintain, and contribute to our code base. We use GitHub to open source LifterLMS and ever-growing library of premium add-ons (request an invite to collaborate on our add-ons). As an external collaborator, here is how we welcome your contributions to our software:

- We encourage and welcome any contribution to our code. If you find a bug, report it in an Issue for that plugin's GitHub repository.
- Anyone from inside or outside our team can submit a potential code change or 'Pull Request'. Once submitted, the repository owners review these code changes, post comments, suggest changes, then merge or reject them.
- If you're not a developer, you can still get involved by contributing a translation through GitHub or directly to a plugin through GlotPress on WordPress.org

# Welcome to LifterLMS
